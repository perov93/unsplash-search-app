 Unsplash Search App 

For this task you are required to create a page that will have search bar.
When the users types in a word or a combination of words, you need to create a request to query photos from the unsplash.com using their public API.  
Then you need to display fetched photos in a grid(10 per page).

Also you need to implement a simple pagination so the user can easily switch between different pages.
